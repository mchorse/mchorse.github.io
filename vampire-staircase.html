<p class='action'>Priest #1 stopped grinning. This news shocked him.</p>
<p class='character'>PRIEST #1</p>

<p class='action'>Priest walks backwards to his chest. He opens it, and brings a silver ingot to Joe. </p>
<p class='character'>PRIEST #1</p>
<p class='dialogue'>I have only one silver ingot. It's really rare. Unfortunately, you can't make sword out of one ingot. You'll need to go deep underground to gain more silver. Go to the mineshaft which is outside the village, and gather some silver ore. It's really rare. Hurry up! You don't have much time. We'll be waiting for you...</p>
<p class='action'>Joe nods and leaves the building.</p>
