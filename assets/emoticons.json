        "0.1": "Initial release. It adds custom player animations and emote system, featuring over 25 emotes (custom and from Fortnite).",
        "0.2": "Second update. This update adds 10 new emotes, support for vanilla armor, and tweaks the key binds to allow instant switch of an emote (instead of moving or pressing stop emote key).",
        "0.2.1": "Third update. This quick patch provides few important tweaks, it removed the F1 watermark, fixes dying animation not showing up during emote, adds empty sound events for dances, adds an option in emote configuration menu to disable non-emote animations, decreased the file size of the jar, and finally added extra information on the crash screen (so it would be easy to understand what's going on with access key)."
